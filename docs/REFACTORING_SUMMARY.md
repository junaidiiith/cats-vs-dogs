# Repository Refactoring Summary

## 🎯 What Was Accomplished

This repository has been completely refactored according to your requirements to create a clean, pip-publishable package structure. Here's what was accomplished:

## ✅ Requirements Met

### 1. **Removed Unnecessary Files**

- ❌ Deleted all old `src/` directory files
- ❌ Removed multiple `requirements*.txt` files
- ❌ Removed old test files (`test.py`, `test_oci.py`, `test_real_data.py`)
- ❌ Removed old execution scripts (`main.py`, `example.py`, `simple_example.py`, `demo_results.py`)
- ❌ Removed old experiment runners (`run_real_experiment.py`, `run_simple_experiment.py`)
- ❌ Removed old documentation files (moved to `docs/` folder)

### 2. **Removed Library Assumptions**

- ❌ Eliminated all `try-except ImportError` blocks
- ❌ Removed `_AVAILABLE` flags and conditional imports
- ❌ Code now assumes all libraries in `requirements.txt` are present
- ✅ Clean, direct imports throughout the codebase

### 3. **Single Requirements File**

- ✅ Single `requirements.txt` with all necessary dependencies
- ✅ Includes core scientific computing, ML, visualization, and data processing libraries
- ✅ No more dependency confusion

### 4. **Single Test File**

- ✅ One comprehensive test file: `tests/test_experiment.py`
- ✅ Tests experiment with different sample sizes (50, 200, 500 samples per species)
- ✅ Tests all three infant axis methods (LDA, PCA, Logistic Regression)
- ✅ Tests individual components (data loader, OCI calculator, analyzer)
- ✅ All tests pass successfully

### 5. **Documentation in docs/ Folder**

- ✅ Moved all documentation to `docs/` folder
- ✅ Includes: `EXPERIMENT_GUIDE.md`, `FINAL_SUMMARY.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- ✅ Clean separation of code and documentation

### 6. **Pip-Publishable Package Structure**

- ✅ Professional package structure: `cats_vs_dogs_cuteness/`
- ✅ Proper `setup.py` and `pyproject.toml` files
- ✅ `MANIFEST.in` for distribution control
- ✅ Entry points for CLI (`cats-vs-dogs-cuteness`)
- ✅ Can be installed with `pip install -e .`
- ✅ Can be published to PyPI

## 🚀 How to Use the New Package

### Installation

```bash
cd cats_vs_dogs_cuteness
pip install -e .
```

### Command Line Usage

```bash
# Run with default parameters (500 samples per species)
cats-vs-dogs-cuteness

# Run with custom sample size
cats-vs-dogs-cuteness --samples 1000

# Run with different method
cats-vs-dogs-cuteness --method pca
```

### Python API Usage

```python
from cats_vs_dogs_cuteness import run_experiment

# Run the complete experiment
results = run_experiment(
    n_samples=500,
    output_dir="results",
    method="lda"
)
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test file
python tests/test_experiment.py
```

## 🔧 Development Tools

### Makefile Commands

```bash
make help              # Show available commands
make install           # Install package
make test              # Run tests
make example           # Run example script
make cli               # Run CLI
make clean             # Clean build artifacts
make build             # Build package
make dist              # Create distribution
```

## 📊 What the Package Does

The refactored package provides:

1. **Objective Cuteness Index (OCI)**: Measures cuteness using craniofacial juvenility
2. **Multiple Methods**: LDA, PCA, and Logistic Regression for learning the infant axis
3. **Flexible Sample Sizes**: From 50 to 1000+ samples per species
4. **Statistical Analysis**: T-tests, effect sizes, confidence intervals
5. **Comprehensive Output**: Reports, models, and data files
6. **Command Line Interface**: Easy-to-use CLI for experiments
7. **Python API**: Programmatic access to all functionality

## 🎉 Benefits of the Refactoring

### For Users

- ✅ **Simple Installation**: `pip install -e .`
- ✅ **Clear Usage**: Well-documented CLI and API
- ✅ **Reliable**: All tests pass, no dependency issues
- ✅ **Professional**: Clean, maintainable code

### For Developers

- ✅ **Standard Structure**: Follows Python packaging best practices
- ✅ **Easy Testing**: Comprehensive test suite
- ✅ **Clear Documentation**: Well-organized docs folder

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test the Package**: Run `make test` to verify everything works
2. **Try Examples**: Run `make example` to see the package in action
3. **Customize**: Modify parameters and methods for your needs
4. **Publish**: If desired, publish to PyPI for public distribution
5. **Extend**: Add new features or datasets as needed

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

The repository has been successfully transformed from a collection of experimental scripts into a professional, pip-publishable Python package that:

- ✅ **Runs the entire experiment** with clean, focused code
- ✅ **Assumes all libraries are present** (no more dependency assumptions)
- ✅ **Has a single requirements.txt** with all necessary dependencies
- ✅ **Contains a single test file** that tests the complete experiment
- ✅ **Organizes documentation** in a dedicated docs folder
- ✅ **Follows Python packaging standards** for easy distribution

The package is now ready for production use, distribution, and further development! 🎉
